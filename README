Introduction
============

python-krbV allows python programs to use Kerberos 5 authentication and
security. It is designed to be a thin wrapper around the krb5 C api. Familiarity
with the C api will be of great help when using this module. 

Installation
============

As you know, you can use easy_install or pip install python-krbV from PyPI.
Since python-krbV is a C Python extension module, of course gcc compiler should
be installed before anything goes.

::

    $ sudo easy_install python-krbV

If you are running RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Fedora, CentOS, or any
other RHEL-based Linux distributions, you can install by yum.

::

    $ sudo yum install python-krbV

Or, if you would like do everything manually, download the tarball, extract,
and build in your ways.

::

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
